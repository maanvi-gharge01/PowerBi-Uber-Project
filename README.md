This project explores **Uber's financial performance and customer behavior across U.S. cities in 2024** through two interactive Power BI dashboards. The objective was to uncover key patterns in ride profitability, discount impact, rider segmentation, and payment preferences to guide strategic insights.

We used a combination of **DAX measures**, calculated fields, and a variety of **insightful visualizations**â€”including heatmaps, trend lines, stacked bars, and completion metricsâ€”to deliver clear, compelling data storytelling.

Dataset: Simulated dataset for sample Uber rides
SQL was used to analyze the Uber rides dataset and extract the necessary insights for the Power BI dashboard. This included querying for profit, ride completion, rider segmentation, discount behavior, and payment method analysis. The detailed SQL queries used for this project are provided in the attached PDF.
